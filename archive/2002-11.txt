Subject: [concurrency-interest] Clock at micro and nano second precision
Message-ID: <20021113201257.44658.qmail@web20108.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm very interested in this b/c of the java.lang.Clock
object's ability to get the currentTime in such small
units.  It appears that there is no implementation
available.  

Is there a way to get micro or nano second time the
way java.lang.Clock is doing without waiting for  the
new JDK?  Or is this something that has to be built
into the JVM?

Thanks,
Mark

It is up to the VM to export this functionality and presently there is
no API to do this. You would have to resort to native code and make a
direct system call.

Note that the Clock API doesn't require nanosecond or microsecond
accuracy, only precision (I think I got that the right way around) -
the implementation could simply return System.currentTimeMillis()
multiplied by the appropriate amount.

To get micro-second time or nano-second time, I would 
recommend that you explored a JNI alterantive, 
I know that Doug Lea wrote a JNI nonosecond timer
for sparc architecture. You do have to write the
foundation in c or some other language
though. So there is not really a way to do
it in "pure" java, unless you wait.

For the LinkedQueue class:

	1. Does the add method insert at the end of the list?

	2. Does the Iterator support the remove method?

Hi Bill; Nice to see you on this list.

Yes to both.

If someone were to supply some documentation someday, it would say
such things. (We ARE busily doing work on JSR-166, but unfortunately
haven't made much progress on solidifying javadocs lately.)
