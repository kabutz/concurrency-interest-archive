Message-ID: <3F0B1B9C.51DAFAD1@ei.uvigo.es>

For those interested. We implemented (my students and I during the
course this year)
a ConcurrentList data structure. More information:
http://www.ei.uvigo.es/~formella/doc/cd02/ConcurrentList/index.html
the "package" can be downloaded at:
http://www.ei.uvigo.es/~formella/doc/cd02/ConcurrentList.tgz

remarks: it's a 0.x version, definitely not heavily tested
(TestThread incomplete!)

My apologies if this is a bit off-topic; I'm new to this concurrency 
framework.

I would like to use the Module concept of System V Streams. It appears 
this framework has much, or most, of what's required to build it but the 
framework does not appear to implement the concept. Is that correct?

If it is correct, are there any open-source Module implementations based 
on this concurrency framework?


Thanks,

Jan

Message-ID: <16146.60831.431317.119104@altair.cs.oswego.edu>

A few weeks later than planned, preliminary test release 2 of JSR-166
is now available, at 
  http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/jsr166/

Unlike the first release, this one should work "out of the box" on
solaris and linux-x86, requiring only some environment variable
settings after unpacking the (single) jar file. There is also an
emulation mode that works on other platforms, although very slowly --
suitable only for testing and evaluation.

Note that there's been a bit of rearrangement of classes and methods
since PR1.

We are nearing time for JCP Community review, so all feedback will be
especially welcome. And we are still interested in comments about my
"Locks" posting --
http://altair.cs.oswego.edu/pipermail/concurrency-interest/2003-June/000467.html
We are not 100% sure whether to remove it.

Hi Doug,

I am unable to unpack the "jsr166-0.3.21-dist.jar". It looks like that the
file is corrupted. I have tried downloading it couple of times, but it fails to
unpack. Could you please varify this.

Thanks,

No problems here -- the file is large, but fine.

This might be due to bandwidth quenching on some box between here and there
because it thinks that people are trying to download movies 
from me :-). I'll look into it, but you might try alternatively:
  ftp://altair.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/jsr166-0.3.21-dist.jar 

Sorry for problems!

File is okay.. Check the file size it should be 22356384 bytes.
I could successfully unpack it.

You'd expect this to show up as a System property, like today we have:

 

sun.cpu.endian = little

sun.cpu.isalist = pentium i486 i386

 

Maybe 1.5 will have a "sun.cpu.count" or some such.

1.4 already has Runtime#availableProcessors().

This is a more complicated issue than it might immediately 
appear.  Clearly, number of available processors is one of the important 
inputs in determining a sensible thread pool size.  On the other hand, the 
choice of size of thread pools really is a _deployment_ time decision, not 
a development time decision.  In most enterprise applications, the 
application deployer will have more information available with which to 
make a sensible decision (specific hardware information, other applications 
running on the same server, administrative policies, etc) than will the 
developer.  So having the developer "auto-size" these pools may encourage 
making these formulas hard-coded within applications, instead of exposing 
them and letting the application deployer make those decisions.

Facilities like Xeon HT further complicate the question -- is a Xeon HT one 
processor, or two?  It depends on the question that you're really trying to 
answer, and I'm sure you could pose questions that support either answer as 
the "right, obvious, most sensible" answer.

	Thanks to Rob Eden for the tip about using the 1.4.1 Runtime.getAvailableProcessors() that I had never noticed.

Once tested on my single CPU XEON 2.4 Ghz I obtain 2 processors, so this returns on NT 2003 the number of LOGICAL processors (not tested with other OS).
For info, multithreading can be disabled in the motherboard setup, at least on my Dell PowerEdge1600SC MB.

Obtaining the number of physical processors would be useful but the number of logical processors is more interesting from my current point of view

	I totally agree with Brian, that setting pool sizes... Is a important deployment time decision with many factors to take into consideration but for a quick setup we can try to provide safe default values which can be overriden by the admin at a later time.

	Merci ... Thanks

Subject: [concurrency-interest] Owned Locks
Message-ID: <3F20F274.1040605@cqrdata.com>

Currently in jsr-166 the locks are all "owned" and managed by the 
current thread.

If for example in a multi threaded client server application, where each 
request may
be handled by a thread in a thread pool, and a session id is allocated 
to a particular
client, thread based locking is not too useful. Locking based on the 
session id would
be ideal.

Another example is in a transaction based resource manager a transaction 
id (Xid in jta)
it is possible to suspend a transaction and resume it on another thread 
based on the
id. Again locking based on the transaction id would be better.

Would it be possible to change the lock class so that the methods take 
an Object
parameter say called "caller" which is used for the ownership of the 
lock as follows:

public interface Lock {
    void lock(Object caller);
    void lockInterruptibly(Object caller);
    Condition newCondition();
    boolean tryLock(Object caller);
    boolean tryLock(Object caller, long time, TimeUnit unit);
    void unlock(Object caller);
}

Then we could have an interface ThreadBasedLock which is equivalent to 
the Lock
interface possibly extending Lock possibly not with out the caller 
parameters as
follows:

public interface ThreadBasedLock extends Lock {
    void lock();
    void lockInterruptibly();
    boolean tryLock();
    boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit);
    void unlock();
}

an ThreadBasedLock implementation could wrap a lock or extend a lock for 
example:

public class ThreadBasedWrapperLock implements ThreadBasedLock {

    private Lock wrapped;

    public void lock() {
        wrapped.lock(Thread.currentThread());
    }
}

or:

public class ThreadBasedReentrantLock implements ReentrantLock {

    public void lock() {
        super.lock(Thread.currentThread());
    }
}

It may even be better to make ThreadBasedLock a class that just wraps a 
lock like
my example ThreadBasedWrapperLock.

I think this would add extra functionality and extra uses cases for the 
locking api
without complicating it too much.

Any comments?

 From Richard.

Thanks for the comments!

We intentionally left out two variants of possible lock-based
interfaces -- transaction locks as you mentioned, as well as
"upgradable" read-write locks. Both for the same reasons: We are less
confident about the best forms they should take, most of the desired
effects can usually be obtained using the APIS we DO include, and we
don't know of standardized implementations with broad enough
applicability to include.

For transaction-style locks the most typical scenario is to use a
transaction identifier that is associated with the current thread.  As
in your:

If you set a ThreadLocal (perhaps in beforeExecute) to the current
session ID, then you can elide the argument in lock() etc, and use the
ordinary Lock API (with, of course, your own special implementation.)
I believe this is pretty common, although does not always nicely
apply. But doing more than this at the API level starts intruding into
other Java transaction package APIs, and would invite us to consider
support for database and distributed lock frameworks, which is clearly
outside our scope.


While I'm at it (and in the process, implicitly answering a related
question someone had a few weeks ago), we had similar discussions
about supporting three- or five- flavor schemes for upgradable
ReadWrite locks (see e.g., Gray and Reuter's Transaction book), and
decided against defining them at least for JSR-166.  Both are still
candidates for any follow-up extensions to j.u.c.  We are hoping that
releasing the basic stuff in j.u.c that we do provide will help propel
people to experiment with such things, to release non-standardized
packages (like I did with dl.u.c), and on the basis of experience,
eventually standardize.
