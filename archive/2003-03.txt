Hi,

Would anyone like to share opinions about using ownership
types as a concurrent programming tool?

http://www.org.lcs.mit.edu/pubs/boyapati.pdf
http://pmg.lcs.mit.edu/~chandra/publications/oopsla02.pdf

Any experiences and opinions are appreciated, but I am
especially interested in:
- complexity (to the programmer) vs. the proposed JSR-166 API
- implementation costs vs. the proposed JSR-166 API
- efficiency vs. the proposed JSR-166 API
- experiences of anybody who has actually used it
- situations that might favor either approach

I'm definitely not implying that there is anything wrong
with the current proposal.  I'm just curious about how
it compares to this particular alternative. 

Thanks,
Curt

David,

No, I hadn't seen somnifugi before.  At first glace it doesn't appear to be
all that light.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but for your purposes, you
wanted a full set of JMS interfaces, but only within a process.  I want a
lighter set of interfaces without losing inter-process options.  But I do
thank you for your message, and I will download and review your code.  If it
looks like I can make use of it, we'll certainly be talking more.  Have you
considered what it would take to use a JDBC database inside a queue to help
support persistence and distribution?  Reliability and persistence of the
queue are absolutely vital to my needs.

As for JSR 166 Queues ... have you looked at what it might take to implement
a Queue over somnifugi?

Basically, I want your standard put/get type queue, ideally with a couple of
the extra notions that are expressed by COS Event Service and JMS.  But I
don't think that even your code, cleanup, polished and repackaged, would be
lightweight enough in terms of interface to go into JSR 166, do you?

Practically, within a server application we have queues.  The current
queuing code in a particular application I am working on .. well, not to put
too fine a point on it, but it sucks.  I will replace it.  However, the JSR
166 Queue is not desirable because of its inheritance, and that is
disappointing.  The desired interface would allow me a nice clean
implementation within my process, and an equally clean interface for
suppliers and consumers when we scale the processing nodes across multiple
machines.

Noel,

Have you looked at http://somnifugi.sourceforge.net/ ? It is JMS-lite,
built on top of Professor Lea's concurrency kit. (I'm not sure what a
high performace messaging kernel would be in context. Do Channels and
LinkedQueues count?) I've used it on several projects to prototype a
system, then separated the parts that have to be in different JVMs using
a JMS that does that work, by reconfiguring instead of recompiling. It
sounds more likely to have the API you want.

Hope that helps,

Dave

Noel,

Is it fair to say you're concerned about having Queue implement 
Collection, and dealing with all the extra implementation weight? Sorry 
if I'm distracting the thread.

I'd love to have you look over the code. If you find problems or just 
have suggestions, I'd love to hear them. (I'll guess that most people on 
this list won't be interested.)

I wouldn't have thought to implement JSR 166 Queues over SomnifugiJMS. 
I'll be doing the reverse: I plan to implement Somnifugi over JSR 166 
Queues, or whatever son-of-Channel seems best. (I'm a customer on this 
list. I enjoy the challenge of tough thready problems, but want people 
who live and breath this stuff to build the core library. SomnifugiJMS 
will be an early adopter.)

SomnifugiJMS is built on Professor Lea's concurrency kit, which has the 
Putable and Takable interfaces. If those interfaces don't survive, I'll 
probably create my own just to keep myself out of trouble. If you need 
them as well, then maybe it is worth our lobbying for them here.

Implementing Putable and Takable over JMS would be easy at first. 
Putable would sit on top of a JMS QueueSender and Takable would sit on 
top of a JMS QueueReceiver. Doing a full JSR 166 Queue implementation 
would require using a JMS QueueBrowser. It'd be easy to do, but perhaps 
challenging to get right. (Several people reading this list have 
described getting message selectors for Channels correct as an 
"interesting problem.")

I think that if I tried to build distributed JSR 166 Queues, I'd quickly 
start to hit boring problems, especially with set-up, that the JMS API 
addresses very well. Thematically, JMS gives Putable and Takable plus an 
ability to manage a collection of Queues and Topics. I've found the JMS 
set up API useful in anything larger than the smallest job-based 
application. (Although I'll admit it could be a case of having a hammer 
and finding a nail.)

If your messages need to live longer than your processes, then most JMS 
implementations (probably all but SomnifugiJMS) will do that for you 
already.  I haven't got plans to do SomnifugiJMS for extra-process 
messaging.

I typically build the whole system using SomnifugiJMS, then use another 
JMS implementation to break it up between machines. Mixing OpenJMS and 
SomnifugiJMS means setting up OpenJMS and changing some JNDI values. I 
think you describe the problem this solves in your last paragraph, 
although you have to make some decisions about persistence vs 
performance. (An optimizeit study showed that SomnifugiJMS spent time on 
thread overhead and logging, and not much else.)

As an alternative, have you looked at JSR 121? It promisses to group 
many physical machines into one big virtual machine. That might be a 
closer fit for your problem if you can wait, but may not address your 
persistence needs.

Subject: [concurrency-interest] TimeoutException in BlockingQueue
Message-ID: <3E7F4A1C.5000306@gemstone.com>

Is the TimeoutException referred to in BlockingQueue.poll(long, TimeUnit) an 
oversight that needs to be removed (as well as in offer) ? The TimeoutException 
is not mentioned in LinkedBlockingQueue, and the docs also say that poll returns 
null if the queue is empty. The method would not return null until it timed out, 
so the specified behavior on timeout is ambiguous. Similarly, offer would not 
return false until it timed out, but is also specified to throw a TimeoutException.

Eric - thanks for pointing this out. Obviously something is amiss.
I'll consult with the rest of the EG on the intent. If a BlockingQueue
can never contain nulls then returning null on timeout is nicer than
throwing an exception. However, if they can contain nulls then we need
the exception.

> The TimeoutException
> is not mentioned in LinkedBlockingQueue

This is a javadoc problem. throw information is not inherited unless
the exception is listed in the throws clause of the method - which I
think it should be in this case anyway, even if TimeoutException
extends InterruptedException.

Thanks,

Subject: [concurrency-interest] Recursion -> FJTasks question
Message-ID: <OFEA0E504F.D453F7B9-ON80256CF7.00540663@db.com>

I'm trying to replace a recursive XML scan, with FJTasks for concurrent processing -- ie when moving to a child element, if it's not a leaf element, then fork(). Below are the main methods of my task class, XMLTask. Now if I use the XMLTask1 -- everything works -- though not as fast as I'd like, (I think) because findChildren may take a while and find many child elements. In order to start queuing child tasks as they're found, I moved to XMLTask2.

However this sometimes never completes --
      my taskGroup.invoke()  (on thread main), never returns, wait()ing in awaitingTermination(),
presumably due to:

But I'm unsure why this would block (or if it's not really but the stack just is always here).


            /** batch the tasks, and coInvoke, before ending  */
            public class XMLTask1
                  private List myTasks;

                  ...

                  public void run() {
                        // call methods that call add(FJTask)
                        findChildren(..);

                        coInvoke((FJTask[])myTasks.toArray(TYPE));
                  }

                  public void add(FJTask t) {
                        myTasks.add(t);
                  }

            /** fork immediately, batch the join at the end */
            public class XMLTask2
                  private List myTasks;

                  ...

                  public void run() {
                        // call methods that call add(FJTask)
                        findChildren(..);

                        Iterator it = myTasks.iterator();
                        while (it.hasNext()) {
                              ((FJTask) it.next()).join();
                        }
                  }

                  public void add(FJTask t) {
                        myTasks.add(t);
                        task.fork();
                  }

I think these two should be equivalent. There's no synchronization in the code other than the tasks all appending a single Vector with messages.
Am I right in thinking a task that isDone(), will not block on join().

Ideas?

An an alternative design, is there a way to not return from taskGroup.invoke(..) until ALL tasks are finished? -- so I could just fork() all the tasks and not need to join()? (There are no dependencies once fork()'d).

Thanks,

Ken.

FYI, I'm running jdk 1.4.1_01-b01, on solaris 8

Hi Ken;

First, the dl.u.c Fork/Join framework won't be part of JSR-166. This
was just a decision about generality -- FJTasks are too nichy to put
into JDK. I'll continue to make them available separately though. But
anyway...

> However this sometimes never completes --

It looks like at least one of your tasks are blocking waiting for
others outside of a FJTask.join or yield, which this framework
explicitly doesn't handle.  In general, all code in the run methods of
FJTasks must be lock-free and IO-free (See my CPJ book sec 4.3 for
some discussion).  While you can in many cases get away with using
locks or IO, they require case-by-case analysis, and might not work
out in your case. (The whole idea of FJTasks is to impose non-blocking
constraitns in exchange for very fast execution on MPs). Also, make
sure that all variables viasible across tasks are declared as
volatile.  From what you wrote, I don't have a more specific
diagnosis, but hopefully this will steer you in the right direction.

-Doug
