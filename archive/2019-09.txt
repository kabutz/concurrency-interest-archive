Hi Keith,

I think this is one for concurrency interest to answer.

Cheers,

I think this doc difference is intentional.

In case of a retry loop, the value may have changed in the case of
computeIfPresent or compute and so the function must be called again with
the new value.

All three state that "The entire method invocation is performed atomically"
and computeIfAbsent merely explains this with the addition "so the function
is applied at most once per key." Since all computations are atomic
operations in ConcurrentHashMap, this seems to be implied in the other
cases rather than explicitly clarified.

How about
The entire method invocation is performed atomically, so the function is
applied at most once per key.
=>

Please drop the discuss at openjdk list from this exchange - thanks.

I was wrong and filed

   1. DK <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK>
   2. JDK-8231592 <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8231592>

Clarify that ConcurrentHashMap compute methods mapping functions execute at
most once
