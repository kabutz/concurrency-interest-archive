Subject: [concurrency-interest] static initialization and thread safety
Message-ID: <9838003A10254741BC6FFADE2ED02B4581DFEE28@OZWEX0205N1.msad.ms.com>

I was wondering what guarantees there are about non-final fields initialized as part of class initialization. Let's consider


Class Point{

    int x, y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
         this.x = x;
         this.y = y;
    }
}

Class Init{
    public static Point p = new Point(1,2)
    public static Point p2;

    static {
        p2 = new Point(3 , 4)
        p2.x = 10
    }

}

If I have multiple threads trying to read p and p2, would ALL threads wait until those objects are fully constructed and assigned to corresponding fields (like in final fields case) due to initial;ization semantics, or is that not the case?

Thanks!
Maciej

The short answer is yes.

This is described in JLS 12.4.2. Detailed Initialization Procedure (
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.4.2),
and expressed via the initialization lock LC. There is also the following
note regarding possible optimizations of initialization procedure: "An
implementation may optimize this procedure by eliding the lock acquisition
in step 1 (and release in step 4/5) when it can determine that the
initialization of the class has already completed, provided that, in terms
of the memory model, all happens-before orderings that would exist if the
lock were acquired, still exist when the optimization is performed."

Needs to be added that due to lazy class initialization it is possible to incur an unintended deadlock, or observe uninitialized values, subject to cross-dependencies. Cross-dependencies are a bad thing, but you cannot always avoid them, or control - due to lazy class initialization.

=================================================

DESCRIPTION
==
Computational linguistics studies natural language in its various
manifestations from a computational point of view, both on the theoretical
level (modeling grammar modules dealing with natural language form and
meaning, and the relation between these two) and on the practical level
(developing applications for language and speech technology). Right from
the start in the 1950ties, there have been strong links with computer
science, logic, and many areas of mathematics - one can think of Chomsky's
contributions to the theory of formal languages and automata, or Lambek's
logical modeling of natural language syntax. The workshop assesses the
place of logic, mathematics, and computer science in present day
computational linguistics. It intends to be a forum for presenting new
results as well as work in progress.
--------------------------------

SCOPE
==
The workshop focuses mainly on logical approaches to computational
processing of natural language, and on the applicability of methods and
techniques from the study of artificial languages (programming/logic) in
computational linguistics. We invite participation and submissions from
other relevant approaches too, especially if they can inspire new work and
approaches.

The topics of LACompLing2017 include, but are not limited to:

- Computational theories of human language
- Computational syntax
- Computational semantics
- Computational syntax-semantics interface
- Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text,
pragmatics
- Computational grammar
- Logic and reasoning systems for linguistics
- Type theories for linguistics
- Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics
- Language processing
- Parsing algorithms
- Generation of language from semantic representations
- Large-scale grammars of natural languages
- Multilingual processing
- Data science in language processing
- Machine learning of language
- Interdisciplinary methods
- Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical,
diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods
- Logic for information extraction or expression in written and spoken
language
- Language theories based on biological fundamentals of information and
languages
- Computational neuroscience of language

IMPORTANT DATES

=================================================

DESCRIPTION
==
Computational linguistics studies natural language in its various
manifestations from a computational point of view, both on the theoretical
level (modeling grammar modules dealing with natural language form and
meaning, and the relation between these two) and on the practical level
(developing applications for language and speech technology). Right from
the start in the 1950ties, there have been strong links with computer
science, logic, and many areas of mathematics - one can think of Chomsky's
contributions to the theory of formal languages and automata, or Lambek's
logical modeling of natural language syntax. The workshop assesses the
place of logic, mathematics, and computer science in present day
computational linguistics. It intends to be a forum for presenting new
results as well as work in progress.
--------------------------------

SCOPE
==
The workshop focuses mainly on logical approaches to computational
processing of natural language, and on the applicability of methods and
techniques from the study of artificial languages (programming/logic) in
computational linguistics. We invite participation and submissions from
other relevant approaches too, especially if they can inspire new work and
approaches.

The topics of LACompLing2017 include, but are not limited to:

- Computational theories of human language
- Computational syntax
- Computational semantics
- Computational syntax-semantics interface
- Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text,
pragmatics
- Computational grammar
- Logic and reasoning systems for linguistics
- Type theories for linguistics
- Models of computation and algorithms for linguistics
- Language processing
- Parsing algorithms
- Generation of language from semantic representations
- Large-scale grammars of natural languages
- Multilingual processing
- Data science in language processing
- Machine learning of language
- Interdisciplinary methods
- Integration of formal, computational, model theoretic, graphical,
diagrammatic, statistical, and other related methods
- Logic for information extraction or expression in written and spoken
language
- Language theories based on biological fundamentals of information and
languages
- Computational neuroscience of language

Subject: [concurrency-interest] Non-volatile reads
Message-ID: <9838003A10254741BC6FFADE2ED02B4581E1C255@OZWEX0205N1.msad.ms.com>

Let's consider the class:

Foo{

   int x = 0;
   volatile int y = 0;

  void write(int newVal) {
     x = newVal;
     y = newVal;
  }

  int getX(){ return x; }

}

I would like to assume that the compiler is NOT going to rewrite the getX() to a constant, and it will actually read it from memory/cache and not from a register. Let's assume one thread is periodically calling write with increasing value, and one other thread is reading x.

Q1. Volatile forces ordering and visibility of writes (x and y) across processors. As far as I see it, when volatile write happens, all store buffers of that core will be flushed in an exclusive manner (by obtaining exclusive flag on the processor). The push will invalidate all other cores cache lines that are related to the data written (not sure how though..). Is that correct?

Q2. Given the above, after the flushing of the buffers happen, the other thread will be forced to re-read x from main mem (or L3 cache) and update its local value,, effectively seeing the new value. Correct?

Q3. Even if y was not volatile, on x-86 the store buffers would eventually be flushed, so eventually reading process would see an updated value of x, perhaps not latest but non-zero value?

Thanks for any pointers/comments.

You are making many assumptions about the behaviour of the compiler without a reference where you got them from. Not that I am asking for references, just pointing out how early your reasoning went wrong.

JMM only guarantees happens-before edges between writing to x (x=newVal) and reading from x (return x), if you have program order between them (same thread writes, then reads), or a happens-before edge between some other instructions - one instruction appearing in program order after write to x and one instruction appearing before reading x in program order.

For example, if you aren’t reading from y as regularly as you read from x in the thread that reads x, JMM does not guarantee anything about visibility of x.

You are making many assumptions about the behaviour of the compiler without a reference where you got them from. Not that I am asking for references, just pointing out how early your reasoning went wrong.

JMM only guarantees happens-before edges between writing to x (x=newVal) and reading from x (return x), if you have program order between them (same thread writes, then reads), or a happens-before edge between some other instructions - one instruction appearing in program order after write to x and one instruction appearing before reading x in program order.

For example, if you aren’t reading from y as regularly as you read from x in the thread that reads x, JMM does not guarantee anything about visibility of x.

I would like to assume that the compiler is NOT going to rewrite the getX() to a constant, and it will actually read it from memory/cache and not from a register. Let’s assume one thread is periodically calling write with increasing value, and one other thread is reading x.

Q1. Volatile forces ordering and visibility of writes (x and y) across processors. As far as I see it, when volatile write happens, all store buffers of that core will be flushed in an exclusive manner (by obtaining exclusive flag on the processor). The push will invalidate all other cores cache lines that are related to the data written (not sure how though..). Is that correct?

Q2. Given the above, after the flushing of the buffers happen, the other thread will be forced to re-read x from main mem (or L3 cache) and update its local value,, effectively seeing the new value. Correct?

Q3. Even if y was not volatile, on x-86 the store buffers would eventually be flushed, so eventually reading process would see an updated value of x, perhaps not latest but non-zero value?

Thanks for any pointers/comments.

Hi Maciej,

the issue is not the processor, there are many layers of code transformation before that which you cannot simply assume away. E.g. if you spin on `while (getX() == 0)` then the compiler may just emit an infinite loop since you are clearly not writing to x in the loop.

Regards,

Roland

I agree. The point of this exercise is to understand the low-level processor caches in the presence of volatile. SO let’s assume the variable code is not optimized, the value is read from cache/memory, as described below, I wanted to check if my line of thinking is correct

This is actually a very strong assumption, and it would be violated first in
real life cases.

Correct for some hypothesis about how Java accesses are compiled down, and how
the hardware works. For example, "volatile store" does not always mean "flusing
the store buffer". The thing about "exclusive" is really up to cache coherency
mechanism given hardware employs. Etc.

Correct for some hypothesis how hardware works.

Generic hardware is not obliged to flush the store buffer completely, or in
order. So one can think up the hypothetical hardware example that only flushes
"y", although it would be hard to implement release-acquire there...

Also, if "x" and "y" are on different cache lines, anything that happens to
cache line holding "y" might not happen (or happen late, or even worse) to cache
line holding "x". Reasoning gets simpler if "y" drags the neighbors in its cache
line.

Correct, in the belief that everything else was fine.

<insert more fantasies here>


> Thanks for any pointers/comments.

Now, see, "correct, but..." does not mean "always correct".

Read this:
 http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/j9mm.html

What you want is JDK 9 VarHandles "opaque" mode that guarantees progress. Read
carefully, and you will spot exactly the case you are asking about.

In current implementation, "opaque" will indeed issue the compiler barriers
only, letting the hardware cache coherency to figure out the rest. But if we
meet the hardware which does not provide this, it will be fixed in the JDK
itself, not in some obscure code in user codebase.

Thanks,
-Aleksey

That’s a novice way of looking at Java programs.

IF volatile store of y is not optimized out,
IF non-volatile read of x is not optimized out,
then the barriers will be issued, and the value of x will be visible by "the other" thread.

But those two IFs are not necessarily true. JMM allows to optimize both of them out in your example.

As far as I see it, when volatile write happens, all store buffers of that core will be flushed in an exclusive manner (by obtaining exclusive flag on the processor). The push will invalidate all other cores cache lines that are related to the data written (not sure how though..). Is that correct?

No.  There is only a volatile write.  For the other thread to see
the volatile write, there has to be a volatile read to synchronize
with.

And also I'm going to recommend "Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for
Software Hackers"

... just need to get past all of this "flush the cache lines" stuff.
