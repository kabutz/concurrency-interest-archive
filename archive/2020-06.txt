Subject: [concurrency-interest] ConcurrentSkipListMap visibility guarantees
Message-ID: <60EA08BF-5FDF-488D-BF8B-7F403FC6C66E@imc.com>

Hello concurrency interest,

I just came across some old code that concurrently does the following:

  1.  Remove Object o from ConcurrentSkipListMap
  2.  Mutate Object o
  3.  Add Object o back
Sometimes, the remove will fail.

I was wondering how badly this is abusing the guarantees of ConcurrentSkipListMap, and what makes the remove fail?

Here is some code that reproduces (tried with Java 8u241 and 13.0.2):


public class ConcurrentSkipListMapMissingRemove {
    private final static AtomicLong SEQUENCE_CREATOR = new AtomicLong();
    private final static Comparator<DummyTimer> myTimerComparator = Comparator.comparing(DummyTimer::getSequence);
    private final static ConcurrentSkipListMap<DummyTimer, Long> theTimers = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>(myTimerComparator);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
                DummyTimer myDummyTimer = new DummyTimer();
                myDummyTimer.start();

                while (true) {
                    myDummyTimer.restart();
                }
            });
        }

        Thread.sleep(100_000_000);
    }

    private static class DummyTimer {
        private volatile long theSequence;

        void start() {
            add();
        }

        void restart() {
            remove();
            theSequence = SEQUENCE_CREATOR.getAndIncrement();
            add();
        }

        private void add() {
            theTimers.put(this, theSequence);
        }

        private void remove() {
            if (theTimers.remove(this) == null) {
                System.out.println("Ooops, failed to remove...");
            }
        }

        public long getSequence() {
            return theSequence;
        }
    }
}

Thanks,

Alex

DummyTimer has no constructor, so they are all created with a sequence of
zero, so initially they compare equal, so the map considers them
equivalent, and so the initial add may fail.

Ah yes, I dumbed down the example too much…

Here it is again (But now with theSequence being updated inside add):

public class ConcurrentSkipListMapMissingRemove {
    private final static AtomicLong SEQUENCE_CREATOR = new AtomicLong();
    private final static Comparator<DummyTimer> COMPARATOR = Comparator.comparing(DummyTimer::getSequence);
    private final static ConcurrentSkipListMap<DummyTimer, Long> TIMERS = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>(COMPARATOR);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
                DummyTimer myDummyTimer = new DummyTimer();
                myDummyTimer.start();

                while (true) {
                    myDummyTimer.restart();
                }
            });
        }

        Thread.sleep(100_000_000);
    }

    private static class DummyTimer {
        private volatile long theSequence;

        void start() {
            add();
        }

        void restart() {
            remove();
            add();
        }

        private void add() {
            theSequence = SEQUENCE_CREATOR.getAndIncrement();
            TIMERS.put(this, theSequence);
        }

        private void remove() {
            if (TIMERS.remove(this) == null) {
                System.out.println("Ooops, failed to remove...");
            }
        }

        public long getSequence() {
            return theSequence;
        }
    }
}

The comparator is called with two keys in the map.  Even normally, the map
has to deal with the possibility of a key being asynchronously removed
while the comparator is running.  But it's really too much to expect that
the map will be able to sanely handle the value of the key changing and
being reinserted elsewhere in the map while the comparator is running.

Another way to look at it is that a key might be in use by a comparator for
an arbitrarily long time after it has been removed, so the key object can
never be mutated and reused.

Thanks for the quick reply Martin.

That does sound pretty fair.

Subject: Re: [concurrency-interest] ConcurrentSkipListMap visibility guarantees

The comparator is called with two keys in the map.  Even normally, the map has to deal with the possibility of a key being asynchronously removed while the comparator is running.  But it's really too much to expect that the map will be able to sanely handle the value of the key changing and being reinserted elsewhere in the map while the comparator is running.

Another way to look at it is that a key might be in use by a comparator for an arbitrarily long time after it has been removed, so the key object can never be mutated and reused.

Ah yes, I dumbed down the example too much…

Here it is again (But now with theSequence being updated inside add):

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

DummyTimer has no constructor, so they are all created with a sequence of zero, so initially they compare equal, so the map considers them equivalent, and so the initial add may fail.

Hello concurrency interest,

I just came across some old code that concurrently does the following:

  1.  Remove Object o from ConcurrentSkipListMap
  2.  Mutate Object o
  3.  Add Object o back
Sometimes, the remove will fail.

I was wondering how badly this is abusing the guarantees of ConcurrentSkipListMap, and what makes the remove fail?

Here is some code that reproduces (tried with Java 8u241 and 13.0.2):


public class ConcurrentSkipListMapMissingRemove {
    private final static AtomicLong SEQUENCE_CREATOR = new AtomicLong();
    private final static Comparator<DummyTimer> myTimerComparator = Comparator.comparing(DummyTimer::getSequence);
    private final static ConcurrentSkipListMap<DummyTimer, Long> theTimers = new ConcurrentSkipListMap<>(myTimerComparator);

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
            CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
                DummyTimer myDummyTimer = new DummyTimer();
                myDummyTimer.start();

                while (true) {
                    myDummyTimer.restart();
                }
            });
        }

        Thread.sleep(100_000_000);
    }

    private static class DummyTimer {
        private volatile long theSequence;

        void start() {
            add();
        }

        void restart() {
            remove();
            theSequence = SEQUENCE_CREATOR.getAndIncrement();
            add();
        }

        private void add() {
            theTimers.put(this, theSequence);
        }

        private void remove() {
            if (theTimers.remove(this) == null) {
                System.out.println("Ooops, failed to remove...");
            }
        }

        public long getSequence() {
            return theSequence;
        }
    }
}

Thanks,

Alex
