As you might have noticed, a series of power problems brought down this list, the jsr166 repo, mail, and other services for a few weeks. We are back up with some new parts and equipment. We didn't lose any data, but (re)configuring and (re)installing some things led to a few changes. If you notice anything broken, please let me know.

-Doug
