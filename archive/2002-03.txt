I'd see such a predicate as inherently problematic, because there's no
synchronization to enforce that the result still holds after it's been
read.

That is, imagine that you called ``task.isRunning()'' and got a false
result, but before you did anything based on that information, it was
removed from the queue and starts running.

Subject: [concurrency-interest]Concurrency Utilities BOF at JavaOne

We will be having a Concurrency Utilities BOF this year at JavaOne.
It's scheduled for Wednesday, March 27th at 8 pm.  Fortuitously (or
maybe with a little help on the inside from Josh Bloch) that's the
same day that Doug and Josh will be giving their talk.  They're both
planning to attend, and the plan is for the BOF to be an extended Q&A
session for the talk, with both the existing utilities and JSR-166
being fair game.

If you're at the conference, please come along!
